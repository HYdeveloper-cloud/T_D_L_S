Description
A To-Do list is a written or digital list of tasks, goals, or activities that need to be completed. It can be personal, professional, or project-specific, and it's designed to help manage time, improve productivity, and reduce the chances of forgetting important tasks.
Key elements include:

- Tasks: Each item represents something that needs to be done.
- Status: Items can be marked as pending, in progress, or completed.
- Priorities: Important or urgent tasks can be highlighted or ranked.
- Deadlines: Some items may have due dates to stay on track.

To-Do lists can be as simple as a handwritten checklist or as advanced as a task-tracking app with reminders and collaboration tools. Whether it's planning a vacation, organizing your day, or managing a work project, a To-Do list keeps everything in sight and under control.
